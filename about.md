Hi, Iâ€™m a 21 year old football(not soccer!) enthusiast and full stack web engineer.

I interned at Commonfloor which is a Realestate based startup which was acquired by a bigger fish Quikr in the first few months of 2016.

I work as a backend developer writing services and scripts for Quikr Homes.

Jekyll helped me setup the website with its out of the box features.
