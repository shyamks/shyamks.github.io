Jekyll is built in ruby. The executable is available in a gem.

    $ gem install jekyll -v 3.0.3
    $ jekyll new my-site
    
This creates a directory called my-site with this structure.

    +-- _config.yml
    +-- _includes
    |   +-- footer.html
    |   +-- header.html
    +-- _layouts
    |   +-- default.html
    |   +-- post.html
    +-- _posts
    |   +-- 2016-11-16-play-build-more-cubes.md
    |   +-- 2016-11-216-markdown-is-awesome.md
    +-- _site
    +-- index.html

- *_config.yml* contains the meta data about the site.
- *_layouts* has the layouts of the site which is used through a yaml block on top of each page.
- *_includes* has the include files such as _header.html_ and _footer.html_ .
- *_posts* has the blog posts as expected.
- *_site* is the directory where the built code of the site is generated by jekyll.

```
$ jekyll build
```

This will build the directory inside _site.

The structure is simple and self explanatory.
